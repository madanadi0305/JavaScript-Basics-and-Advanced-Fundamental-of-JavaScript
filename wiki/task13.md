## Task13
### write a JS program which returns 1 if a given year is a leap year and 0 if the given year is not leap year

 Use if-else to apply conditions in logic. (Hint: Leap year is exactly divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100 but those divisible by 100 are leap if they are also divisible by 400). Your output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (year) as a parameter of your function.

Steps:

- Define a new variable to print 0 or 1
- Use if to check condition 1 (divisibility by 4 and 100)
- Use else if to check condition 2 (divisibility by 400 and 100)
- Use else to print 0
- Create an output variable and store the result in it
- Return the output variable
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
