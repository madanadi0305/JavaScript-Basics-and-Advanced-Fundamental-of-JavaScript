# To-Do : Write a JS program for sum & product

In this program, we are going to four variables a,b, sum and product and going to calculate the sum and product of two numbers.

- Open `practice07.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

```js
var a=5;
var b=7;
var sum = a+b;
var product = a*b;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Sum is",sum);
* [ ]  console.log("Product is",product);
