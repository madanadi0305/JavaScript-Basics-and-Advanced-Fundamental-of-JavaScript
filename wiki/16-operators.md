# Arithmetic Operators
Operators are various symbols which are used to perform any logical or mathematical 
operations on variables.

Let’s suppose you want to add 3 to a variable, you can do it
by adding 3 to the variable and assign it back using ‘=’ to the same variable again.

- Various arithmetic operators are:  `+` to add, `-` to subtract, `* `to multiply and `/` to divide numbers.
- `%` returns the remainder of a division. 
- Remainders are used often in programming, so make sure to remember this operator. 


Various shortcuts to update a variable using above arithmetic operators are given below

```js
Shortcuts for using operators
a = a + 1 ---> a+=1
a = a - 1 ---> a-=1
a = a * 1 ---> a*=1
a = a / 1 ---> a/=1
a = a % 1 ---> a%=1
