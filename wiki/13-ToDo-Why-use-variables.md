# ToDo : Write a JS Program to use variables.


Variables are very useful when you repeatedly print similar text. In the below example, if you want to change the word "Thank You" to another word "Thanks", you only need to change it once, not three times.

Steps:

- Open `practice05.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

```js
var text = "Thank You for joining Konfinity!,";
```
* [ ]  console.log("Print", text + " Rahul ");
* [ ]  console.log("Print",text + " Pooja ");
* [ ]  console.log("Print",text + " Neha ");
