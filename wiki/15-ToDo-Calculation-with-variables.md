# To-Do : Write a program to show Calculations With Variables


Let’s suppose you want to add 3 to a variable, you can do it by adding 3 to the variable and using ‘=’ assign it back to the same variable again. You can use + to add, - to subtract, * to multiply and / to divide numbers. % returns the remainder of a division. Make sure to remember these operators as you will use them frequently. Given below is an example.

Hint:

- OpenOpen `practice06.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var num = 100;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Initial value ",num);
```js
num = num + 50;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Addition result ",num);
```js
num = num - 20;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Subtraction result ",num);
```js
num = num * 5;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Multiplication result ",num);
```js
num = num / 10;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Division result ",num);
```js
num = num % 10;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Remainder is ",num);
