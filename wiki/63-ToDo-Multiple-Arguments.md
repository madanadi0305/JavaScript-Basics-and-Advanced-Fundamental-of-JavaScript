# To-Do : Write a JS Program to Pass Function with Multiple Argument

Here, we have created a function intro that takes 3 arguments. These arguments are assigned to 3 parameters with name myname, myage, and myplace. Notice that the order of arguments is perfectly matched with the order of parameters in function


- Open `practice26.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
function intro(myname, myage, myplace) {
  console.log("My name is ", myname);
  console.log("My age is ", myage);
  console.log("I live in ", myplace);
}

intro("Rajesh", 21, "Delhi");
```
