# To-Do : Write a JS program to find Even Or Odd Numbers


We will write a program to find whether a natural number is even or odd. On the right side, we have the different steps you need to follow. On the left, you will see how to execute the steps. Note: prompt() is used to ask the user for data. Letâ€™s start.


- Open `practice13.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var a = //Enter a natural number
 if(a%2===0 && a>0){
console.log( "Even number" , a);
}
else if (a%2===1 && a>0){
console.log("Odd number", a);
}
else{
console.log( "Non natural number", a);
}
```
