# Functions

A function is a piece of code that is specially designed to perform a specific task. For eg: console.log () is a function that prints a given string to our console. Functions are very important for the reusability of code. Once you create a function for a task, it can be used whenever the task is required.




```js
function functionName(){
   //Run this code   (Run this code if the function is called)
}
```

## Creating And Calling Functions

You can define a function using the function keyword, followed by functionname(). You can call a function be writing functionname().
The function will execute the code written inside { }. In the given example, first() calls the `first` function which prints `EDITH` to the console.




```js
function first(){
  console.log("EDITH");
}
first();
```

Output

```
EDITH
```
