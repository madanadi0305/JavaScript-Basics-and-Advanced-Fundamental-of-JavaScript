# To-Do : Write a JS program to Update Variables

To update a variable, you simply assign a new value to the current variable using =. When you update a variable, you don't need to declare it again using var. JavaScript runs from top to bottom. When running your code, notice the most recently updated value assigned to a variable. In the example below, the Final value of the variable num is 15.



- Open `practice05.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

```js
var num =7;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Value of num is ",num);
```js
num = 10;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Value of num is ",num);
```js
num = 15;
```
* [ ]  console.log("Value of num is ",num);
