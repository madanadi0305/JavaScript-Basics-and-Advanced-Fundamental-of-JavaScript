# What is statement ? | How to print `Hello World` ? | How to leave notes ?


## Statement

A statement is a command that the programmer gives to the computer

For example :- `Print Hello world`

To print `Hello world` in JS you can use `console.log()`.
While using `console.log()`, make sure to put your text in double " quotes as shown below:

```
console.log("Hello World")
```

Text like "Hello World" is called
a string.


## Semi-Colon (;)

Most of the statements end with a semi-colon (;). Your code may work without it but
it's better to put `;` at the end of each line to avoid unexpected errors

```js
// Use Semi-Colon(;) at the end of the line
console.log('Hello World');
```


## Comments in Javascript
To create a comment, put two forward-slashes `//` in front of the code. When you use `//`, all text to the right will be ignored, until the next line (this is called commenting out). You can also use comments to leave notes.

```js
console.log("Hello World");
//console.log("Hello World");
//Lines will be commented
```

```js
//Output
Hello World
```
