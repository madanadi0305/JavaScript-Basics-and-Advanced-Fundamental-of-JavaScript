# Fundamentals-of-JS
## Task14
### write a JS program which calculates if the number is greater than 13 or less than 13.

 If the number is greater,
  the program finds the difference between
   the input number and 13 and multiply it by 2 and
returns the result.
     If the number is less than 13, 
     the program calculate the difference between 13 and input number
      and returns the value as result.
       Your output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (number) as parameter of your function.

Steps:

- Createa function with parameters to store input variables
- Define a new variable to store difference
- Use if to check condition 1 (number is less than 13)
- Use else to check condition 2 (number is greater than or equal to 13)
- Create an output variable and store the result in it
- Return the output variable 
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
