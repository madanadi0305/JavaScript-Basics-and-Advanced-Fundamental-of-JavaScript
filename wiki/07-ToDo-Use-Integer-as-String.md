# ToDo : Write a JS Program to use numbers in ("").


JS interprets strings and integers differently. If you put numbers inside (" "), javascript takes the number as a string and returns output differently. In this demo, you will see the difference between numbers and strings.

Steps:

- Open `practice03.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

* [ ]  console.log("Print",3+5);
* [ ]  console.log("Print","3"+"5");
* [ ]  console.log("Print",'3 + 5');
