# To-Do : Write a JS program to show Usage of Switch Statement



We have used a switch statement on the input variable. In switch, we have mentioned 3 cases and a default case. When the input value matches the case value, the code of the case is run. If there is no match, the default code statement is run.


- Open `practice24.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var i = //Enter a one digit number

switch(i){
    case 0:
        console.log("You have entered 0");
        break;
    case 1:
        console.log("You have entered 1");
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log("You have entered 2");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Your number is greater than 2");
}
```
