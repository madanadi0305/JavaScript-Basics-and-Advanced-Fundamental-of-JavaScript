# To-Do : Comment previous code

You can learn how to write comments in code. Comments can be a single line or more than one line. While working in teams, comments are used to give instructions to other team members or users. Comments are not treated as code and hence, do not affect the output.

Open `practice01.js`

```js
//console.log(‘Hello World’);
//This is a single line comment

/*Comments are used to leave notes.
Some comments are more than one line.
Those are called multi-line comments*/

console.log("Print",35);

//Above code prints 35
```
