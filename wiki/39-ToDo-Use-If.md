# To-Do : Write a JS program to show Usage of If Statement


Using an if statement makes it possible to apply a condition in your logic. If you put a condition in (), the code inside {} will be executed only if the condition is true. Below is an example of an if statement. The score variable is 70, which meets the condition (score >= 60). Therefore, the code inside {} will be executed.


- Open `practice13.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var score = 70;

if(score>=60){
    console.log("Print","Score is good");
}
```
