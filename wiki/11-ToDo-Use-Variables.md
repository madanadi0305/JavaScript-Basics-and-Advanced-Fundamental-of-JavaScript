# To-D0 : Write a JS Program to use variables ?

To print the value of a variable in output, just write the name of the variable in the console. Do not write variable names in (" " ) otherwise Javascript will take it as a string as shown below:

Steps:

- Open `practice04.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

```js
var myname = "Rahul Sharma";
var myage = 21;
console.log("My name is ", myname);
console.log("My age is", myage);
console.log("My name is", "myname");
```
