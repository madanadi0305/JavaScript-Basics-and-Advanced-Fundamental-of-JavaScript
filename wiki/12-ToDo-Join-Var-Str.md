# To-Do : Write a JS Program to join variables and strings.


When code is executing, a variable will be replaced by its value. Therefore, you can treat string variables exactly like strings. You can join a string variable and a string like in the example below.

Steps:

- Open `practice04.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.

```js
var string1 = " konfinity ";
var string2 = "is great!";
console.log("Print",string1 + string2);
console.log("Print","I study in" +  string1);
console.log("Print","My experience " + string2);
```
