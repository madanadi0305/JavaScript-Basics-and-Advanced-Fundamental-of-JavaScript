# To-Do : Write a JS program to show Comparison With (==)



In the below example, we will see how Javascript differentiates between (=) and (==) . We will use (=) to assign value to a variable and (==) to compare only the values with other variables of the same and different types.


- Open `practice13.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var s1 = 5, s2 = "World";
console.log('Compare', s1==46);
console.log('Compare', s1==5);
console.log('Compare', s1=="5");
console.log('Compare', s2=="apples");
console.log('Compare', s2=='World');
```
