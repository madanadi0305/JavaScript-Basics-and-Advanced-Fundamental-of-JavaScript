# Integers
An integer is a type that is used to work with numbers. 
- Never put integers in quotes `(")` or `(')` otherwise Javascript will interpret it as a string and will behave differently.
- You can `add` and `subtract` integers using `+` and `-` respectively

```js
console.log("Konfinity");
console.log(3);
console.log(5+2);
console.log(3-2);
```

```js
//Output
Konfinity
3
7
1
```
