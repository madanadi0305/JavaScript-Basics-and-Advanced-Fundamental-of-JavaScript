# To-Do : Write a JS program using functions

In this program, we are going to define two functions sum and product.

sum() function will have two arguments : a,b

sum(a,b) will calculate and print the sum of a and b.


product() function will have two arguments : a,b

product(a,b) will calculate and print the product of a and b.

- Open `practice08.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
function sum(a,b){
    var s = a+b;
    console.log("Sum is ",s);
}
function product(a,b){
    var p = a*b;
    console.log("Product is ",p);
}

sum(5,4);
sum(4,10);
product(5,4);
product(4,10);
```
* [ ]  Tried different values in sum()
* [ ]  Tried different values in product()


In the above program, we have created two functions (sum and product) which calculate the sum and product of provided arguments respectively and display it. After defining the functions, we call them with passing two values.
