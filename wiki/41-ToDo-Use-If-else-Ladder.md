# To-Do : Write a JS program to show Usage of If - Else If - Else Statement


If the score is greater than 80, then if statement gets executed. If score is less than 80 but is greater than 50, the else if statement gets executed. Otherwise, the else statement gets executed. We will use if-else statements to write the code.


- Open `practice13.js` and comment previous codes.
- Copy the below codes in that file.


```js
var score =60;

if (score>80){
     console.log("Print","score is good");
}

else if(score > 50){
     console.log("Print","Need some improvement");
}

else{
    console.log("Print","Need major improvement");
}
```
