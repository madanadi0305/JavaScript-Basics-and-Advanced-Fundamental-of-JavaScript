# Fundamentals-of-JS
## Task24
### write a JS program which requires directions.

 Using switch case, the program prints "East" for 1 , "West" for 2, "North" for 3 and "South" for 4. In the default case, the output should return "Wrong Input" . In the other 4 cases, the output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (choice) as the parameter of your function.

Steps:

- Open task24.js file.
- Declare variables to store the value of direction
- Apply switch and write case values. Assign directions to a variable as per the case. End with break
- Write default case
- Create an output variable and store the result in it
- Return the output variable
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```js
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
