# Fundamentals-of-JS
## Task24
### write a JS program which returns direction on the basis of input number using switch case.

Declare one result variable. Using switch case, the program prints "East" for 1 , "West" for 2, "North" for 3, "South" for 4 and store the same in result variable also. In the default case, it should print "Wrong Input" and store the same in result variable. At last, the output code should return the resulting variable.

Take input variables (choice) as the parameter of your function.

Steps:

- Open task24.js file.
- Declare variables to store the value of direction
- Apply switch and write case values. Assign directions to a variable as per the case. End with break
- Write default case
- Create an output variable and store the result in it
- Return the output variable
- Assign the function to `module.exports` using `=` . For now, just use the below code:

```js
module.exports = YourfunctionName ;
```
